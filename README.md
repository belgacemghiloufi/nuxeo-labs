Nuxeo Labs
===================

Nuxeo Solution Architects team is daily producing prototypes for our future customers to help them to imagine what can be done with the Nuxeo Platform. Some features recurrently are needed and missing into the Nuxeo Platform.

So, into this Labs, we try to capitalize all developments produced. 

**These development are not recommended for Production platform** as Nuxeo will not support usage of these development. This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no depreciation process, etc...). If some developments can be useful for the Nuxeo Platform according Tech Lead team, we will move these develoments into the next version of Nuxeo Platform. Notice that this has alredy happened, and we can say that Nuxeo Labs contains good candidates for integration in the platform.

Feel free to use it or let's be inspired for your own code.
