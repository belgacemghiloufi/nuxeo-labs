# nuxeo-labs-automation-helpers

This plug-in adds [Scripting Automation Helpers](https://doc.nuxeo.com/x/RIB4AQ). Useful (hopefully) functions that can be used in your Automation Chains. They have been written and tested with Automation _Scripting_ (hence, JavaScript) in mind.

Because they are custom helpers, you will not have autocompletion in Nuxeo Studio, this is normal. You must type the whole ID ot the helper (`FileUtils.saveBlob` for example), case sentitive.

**Security Concerns**: These are _helpers_, they can't be called directly from a REST call for example. Still, you should pay a lot of attention to avoid publishing an Automation Chain which, for example, accepts a dynamic parameter used as a full path server side. This is very bad practice and major security issue.

## Helpers

### FileUtils
A set of helpers to handle files on disk (server side, we are in Automation): Create, load, write, delete. In all cases, you must make sure you have enough right to access the file system server side (helpers are ran server-side, as a "nuxeo" user on Linux, typically, for example).

The original purpose of the `FileUtils` helpers was to be able to quickly create/handle demo data from JavaScript Automation, just creating a few hundred of documents and avoiding creating a Java plug-in, the marketplace package, installing in the test server, etc.

#### VERY IMPORTANT WARNINGS ABOUT SECURITY
* _The helpers_, by essence, _run server side_ of course. And some helpers here can create/write/delete files and/or folders<br/>=> **MAKE SURE YOU DON't ALLOW EXTERNAL CALLS TO ACCESS FILES/FOLDERS OF YOUR SERVER**.
* A helper cannot be called directly by itself, it must be used inside an operation, inside an Automation Chain.
* So: please **BE VERY CAREFUL, and hard code your values, and/or make sure the paths cannot be get/set from a REST call**.

A typical example of very, very wrong way of using these helpers would be a chain that accepts a "path" parameter, and call FileUtils.deleteFile() with this path for example. Just don't do that please.

Here is the list of `FileUtils` helpers:

* `FileUtils.readFileToBlob(path)`
  * Loads the whole content of the file and return the corresponding blob
* `FileUtils.readFileToText(path)`
  * Loads the whole content of the file and returns it as String
  * Caller is responsible for making sure it can be read as a String( don't try with a JPEG, you'll have a corrupt string with NULL chars in it)
* `FileUtils.createFile(path, overwrite)`
  * Creates an empty file at `path`
  * Returns an object (a `File` actually) that can be used with other helpers
  * If a file already exists:
    * If `overwrite` is `false`, the helper returns `null` (and no error is thrown)
    * Else, the existing file is overriden
* `FileUtils.createFile(path)`
  * A shortcut for  `FileUtils.createFile(path, false);`
* `FileUtils.appendToFile(aFile, what)`
  * Appends the string to the file.
  * `aFile` is not a string (full path for example), it is a `File` object, as returned by `FileUtils.createFile(path, overwrite)`.
* `FileUtils.deleteFile(path)`
  * Deletes the file located at full path `path`.
* `FileUtils.deleteFile(aFile)`
  * Deletes `aFile`.
  * Warning: `aFile` is not a string (full path for example), it is a `File` object, as returned by `createFie()` or `appendToFile()` for example.
* `FileUtils.getFiles(path)`
  * Returns an array of the full paths of all the non-hidden/non folder elements found at `path`
  * (first level, non recursive)
* `FileUtils.getFolders(path)`
  * Returns an array of the full paths of all the non-hidden folder elements found at `path`
  * (first level, non recursive)
* `FileUtils.createFolder(where, name)`
  * Creates a new folder at `where`, named `name`
  * Returns true if the folder was created, false otherwise
* `FileUtils.saveBlob(Blob blob, path)`
  * Writes the blob on diak
  * Example of use: Writing a blog extracted for a document.
  
```
var doc, blob;
// Getting a Document by its path
doc = Repository.GetDocument(null, {"value": "/default-domain/mydoc.png"});
// Get the blob
blob = doc["file:fontent"];
// Save it
FileUtils.saveBlob(blob, "/tmp/something/" + blob.getFilename());
```
