## Important Note

**These feature is not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.

- Uncomment elasticsearch.httpEnabled=true in nuxeo.conf if you use the embedded Elasticsearch server

## Use
In studio, add a Generic widget to your layout and set the type to more_like_this. That's it !

To override the default query, add a property 'query' to the widget configuration and set it with a json object (see ES [documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/query-dsl-mlt-query.html)). 
Don't forget to escape all double quotes
You can also reference the current document id by using the value "id" in the query object
