# Description
This plugin contains miscellaneous operations. It was better to group them in this generic "nuxeo-labs-operation" plug-in, instead of creating one dedicated plug-in/operation

# List of Operations 
* `Document > Add Complex Property From Json String` (id `AddComplexProperty`)
  * This operation can add new fields to a multivalued complex metadata. The `value` parameter is a String containing the JSON list of new values for the metadata given in `xpath`
* `Notification > AdvancedSendEmail` (id `AdvancedSendEmail`)
  * Send Email according parameters set.
  * EMail Address resolution is as following if you check `strict` : <ul>
    * If you set a string that starts with 'user:xxxx', will resolve email of username xxxx.
    * I you set a string that starts with 'group:xxxx, will resolve all users and add their email.
    * If none these 2, if the value contains an '@' it is handle as a full eMail address already formated.
    * If there is no match, then throw an exception.
  * If you uncheck the `strict box, you have the same behavior explainÃ¨d above, but the exception is not thrown and the plug-in handles the value as a username:
    * If no match then handles it as a group
    * and if no match again, then empty string
  * You can also put in values:
    * A NuxeoPrincipal
    * Or a list of NuxeoPrincipal
    * Or a list of Strings (resolution is the same as explain previously)
    * Or a list of mixed value
  * If `rollbackOnError` is checked, then error will be catch if one is thrown.
  * For the file value just put the `xpath` value of field that stores the file (`file:content`, `files:/files/0/content`, `myschema:myfield`, `myschema:/myfield/0/content`)
* `User Interface > Navigate To Url` (id: `NavigateToUrl`)
  * Redirect to the a nuxeo URL passed as a parameter, for instance the parameter can be: /nuxeo/site/automation/doc
  * The url must be a URL in the current server can't redirect to another website for example)
* `Services > HTTP: Call` (id: `HTTP Call`)
  * Sends a HTTP request, returns the result as a `StringBlob`
  * Parameters:
    * `method`: As of today, must be either GET or POST
    * `url`: Required. The full URL to call, including every queryString, parameters, ...
    * `headers`: A string, containing a list a `key=value`, separated with a newline, to setup the headers
    * headersAsJSON`: A string containing a JSON object with the headers.
	* `body`: Required if the method is POST
  * Returns a `StringBlob` whose data is a JSON string with the following fields:
    * `status`: The HTTP status code (200, 404, ...). 0 means an error occured during the call itself (before reaching the server)
    * `statusMessage`: The HTTP status message ("OK" for example)
    * `error`: The detailed error when reaching the server or parsing the result failed.
    * `result`: The raw data ans returned by the server
  * Example of JavaScript Automation (**new since nuxeo 7.2), getting a document from a distant nuxeo server:

  ```javascript
function run(ctx, input, params) {
      var headers, resultStringBlob, resultTxt, resultObj;
      // Setup headers
      headers = {
          "Authorization": "Basic QWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjpBZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9y",
          "Accept": "application/json",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
      }
      // Call the operation
      resultStringBlob = HTTP.Call(input, {
		  'method': "GET",
          'url': "http://your_server_address/nuxeo/api/v1//path//",
          'headersAsJSON': JSON.stringify(headers)
      });
      // We have a StringBlob, get just the string from it (using its Java API actually, wrapped in JavaScript)
      resultTxt = resultStringBlob.getString();
      // Now, get the result as an object
      resultObj = JSON.parse(resultTxt);
      // Check the result is OK
      if(resultObj.status == 200) {
         // Here is the doc id for example:
         var docId = resultObj.result.uid;
      }
    
}
```
